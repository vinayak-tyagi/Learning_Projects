# Learning_Projects
These are some of my Machine Learning & Deep Learning Projects. This is NOT a single Project, these are various pojects on different  technologies. Some of the Projects are fusion of multiple ML and DL models.

## Libraries used in projects
- Matplotlib
- seaborn
- pandas
- sklearn 
- OpenCV
- keras with TensorFlow
- Numpy
- NLTK
- Some Inbuilt libraries in Python 

## Machine Learning Techniques used are
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- SVM 
- KNN
- Xgboost
- PCA
- Desicion Tree and Random Forest
- K-Mean Clustering
- Elbow Method

## Deep Learning Techinques with different Models: `KERAS FOLDER` 
- CNN-(Vgg16, ResNet, MobileNet)
- Lstm
- RNN
- Feedforward Network
